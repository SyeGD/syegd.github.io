            Look at my hands
            I'm shaking
            All my body is shaking
            It was only a dream mommy
            He was there
            I couldn't move my
            Head but I was watching
            Him in the mirror
            I knew he was looking at me
            Two invisible eyes
            TWO INVISIBLE-
            REQUIEM
            RIP DAVID
            HELLO?
            CAN ANYONE HEAR ME?
            PLEASE...
            WHERE ARE YOU?
            WHERE ARE YOU? WHERE ARE YOU? WHERE ARE YOU?
            THEY'RE ALL BLINDED...
            THEY DON'T WANT ME...
            AND I DON'T WANT THEM
            THEY DON'T MATTER
            DON'T DON'T
            DON'T REPEAT MY MISTAKES
            IT WASN'T WORTH IT
            PROMISE ME
            YOU WON'T FORGET ME
            DON'T
            OBEY
            THE
            VIRUS
            EXIT
